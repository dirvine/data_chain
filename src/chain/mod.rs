//! #data_chain
//! Data blocks can be chained to provide verifiable assuredness that they contain network valid
//! data and that the data has been validly put onto the network by a previous consensus. This
//! consensus is validated from the data chain itslf through analysis of the chain links.
//!
//! A chain may look like
//!
//! ```norun
//! `link` - all current group members - cryptographically secured as valid
//!
//!  data - DataIdentifiers interspersed in a chain of links
//!
//!  data - each block signed by a majority of previous link
//!
//!  ....
//!
//! `link` - As churn events occur new links are created
//!
//! `link` - each link will have a majority
//!          (usually n - 1 actually) members of previous link
//! ```
//!
//!  The chain, when presented to the current close group (the group identified in last link)
//!  can be validated as holding data that has been agreed by the network over time to exist,
//!  A chain provides cryptographic proofs of data and group memberships over time.
//!
//! The link is a group agreement chain component which is created by sorting the closest nodes
//! to a network node (Address) and sending this hash, signed to that node.
//! The recipient will then receive these, `Votes` and create the chain link.
//! This link will allow the agreed members of the group so sign `DataBlocks` for the chain
//! If a majority of the link members sign the data, it is validly in the chain.
//! On group membership changes, a new link is constructed in the chain and the process repeats.
//! A chain can split and nodes will maintain several chains, dependent on data overlaps with
//! the chains links.
//! The link identifier is the hash of all group members that contains the current node.
//!
//! Containers of Chain Links only may also be maintained in groups to prove historic memberships
//! of a network. It is not well enough understoof the validity of this action, but it may prove
//! valuable in the event of network restarts.
//! Please also see [RFC][1]
//!
